TACNET fixed pages

This bundle contains corrected files:

- dashboard.html (guarded + logout/user chip + holo map area)
- ships.html (guarded + logout/user chip)
- crew.html (guarded + logout/user chip)
- js/app.js (fixed renderer with System/Planet/Tactical views)

Drop these into your project root, replacing existing files with the same names.
Make sure js/supabase.js contains your actual SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_ANON_KEY,
and that css/* and data/stanton.json already exist as in your project.
